<p><strong>Prob3</strong> - Import the <code>FlightDelays</code> data set into <code>R</code>.  Although the data represent all flights for United Airlines and American Airlines in May and June 2009, assume for this exercise that these flights are a sample from all flights flown by the two airlines under similar conditions.

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION: </p>

<p><strong>Prob4</strong> - Run a simulation to see if the \( t \) ratio \( T = (\bar{X} -\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n}) \) has a \( t \) distribution or even an approximate \( t \) distirubiton when the samples are drawn from a nonnormal distribution.  Be sure to superimpose the appropriate \( t \) density curve over the density of your simulated \( T \).  Try two different nonnormal distributions \( \left( Unif(a = 0, b = 1), Exp(\lambda = 1) \right) \) and remember to see if sample size makes a difference (use \( n = 15 \) and \( n=500 \)).</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION:  </p>

<p><strong>Prob6</strong> - A retail store wishes to conduct a marketing survey of its customers to see if customers would favor longer store hours. How many people should be in their sample if the marketers want their margin of error to be at most 3% with 95% confidence, assuming</p>

<ul>
<li>they have no preconceived idea of how customers will respond, and</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION: </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>a previous survey indicated that about 65% of customers favor longer store hours.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION: </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Prob7</strong> - Suppose researchers wish to study the effectiveness of a new drug to alleviate hives due to math anxiety.  Seven hundred math students are randomly assigned to take either this drug or a placebo.  Suppose 34 of the 350 students who took the drug break out in hives compared to 56 of the 350 students who took the placebo.</p>

<ul>
<li>Compute a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students taking the drug who break out in hives.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Do the intervals overlap?  What, if anything, can you conclude about the effectiveness of the drug?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION:  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Compute 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions of students who break out in hives by using or not using this drug and give a sentence interpreting this interval.</li>

<p><strong>Prob8</strong> - An article in the March 2003 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> describes a study to see if aspirin is effective in reducing the incidence of colorectal adenomas, a precursor to most colorectal cancers (Sandler et al. (2003)).  Of 517 patients in the study, 259 were randomly assigned to receive aspirin and the remaining 258 received a placebo.  One or more adenomas were found in 44 of the aspirin group and 70 in the placebo group.  Find a 95% one-sided upper bound for the difference in proportions \( (p_A - p_P) \) and interpret your interval.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION:</p>

<p><strong>Prob9</strong> - The data set <code>Bangladesh</code> has measurements on water quality from 271 wells in Bangladsesh.  There are two missing values in the chlorine variable.  Use the following <code>R</code> code to remove these two observations.</p>

<p><code>&gt; chlorine &lt;- with(Bangladesh, Chlorine[!is.na(Chlorine)])</code></p>

<ul>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><em>Johnson&#39;s \( t \) confidence interval</em> adjusts for skewness by shifting endpoints right or left for positive or negative skewness, respectively.  The interval is \( \bar{X} + \hat{\kappa_3}/(6\sqrt{n})(1 + 2q^2) \pm q(S/\sqrt{n}) \), where \( \hat{\kappa_3} \) is a sample estimate of the population skewness \( E(X - \mu)/\sigma^3 \) and \( q \) denotes the \( 1 - \alpha/2 \) quantile for a \( t \) distribution with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom.  Calculate Johnson&#39;s \( t \) interval for the arsenic data (in <code>Bangladesh</code>) and compare with the formula \( t \) and bootstrap \( t \) intervals.</li>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>

<p><strong>Prob10</strong> - The data set <code>MnGroundwater</code> has measurements on water quality of 895 randomly selected wells in Minnesota.</p>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Compute the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means using the formula \( t \), bootstrap percentile, and bootstrap \( t \) methods and compare your results.  Which interval would you report?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Modify your result from the previous question to obtain a one-sided 95% \( t \) confidence interval (hypothesizing that babies born to nonsmokers weigh more than babies born to smokers).</li>
</ul>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>
